# ORA-01847

ORA-01847: day of month must be between 1 and last day of month

# This error typically occurs when:
## Invalid Day Value:
The day component of a date literal or variable exceeds the number of days in the corresponding month (e.g., attempting to use 'April 31st' as a date, as April only has 30 days).

## Incorrect Date Format Mask:
The format mask used with TO_DATE or similar functions does not correctly interpret the input string, leading to a misinterpretation of the day component.

## Data Type Mismatch:
Attempting to store or convert a non-date value into a DATE or TIMESTAMP column, where the conversion process results in an invalid day.

## Locale Issues:
In some cases, a change in database or client locale settings can affect how date strings are interpreted, potentially leading to this error if the format is not explicitly handled.


# Resolution:
To resolve the ORA-01847 error, review the date values being processed and ensure:
## Valid Day-of-Month:
Verify that the day component of all date values falls within the valid range for their respective months (e.g., 1-31 for months with 31 days, 1-30 for months with 30 days, 1-28/29 for February).
